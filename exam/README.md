## Introduction

Creating an exam portal using Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend is a substantial project that involves multiple components, functionalities, and integrations. Below are the key objectives and steps to create an exam portal with Spring Boot and Angular:

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:**

Implement user registration and login functionality.
Define user roles (e.g., admin, teacher, student) and restrict access based on roles.

- **Exam Management:**

Create and manage exams, including setting up questions, answers, and time limits.
Define different types of questions (multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, etc.).
Implement question randomization to prevent cheating.

- **User Dashboard:**

Provide a dashboard for students and teachers to view their exams and results.
Allow students to enroll in exams.
Enable teachers to create, edit, and publish exams.

- **Exam Taking and Grading:**

Implement a timer for exams.
Allow students to submit answers and auto-grade exams.
Enable teachers to review and manually grade exams.

- **Scoring and Analytics:**

Provide analytics and reports for teachers to track student progress.

- **Security and Data Protection:**

Implement security measures to protect sensitive data.
Secure API endpoints and use token-based authentication (JWT).
Encrypt user passwords and sensitive data in the database.

- **Database Integration:**

Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user data, exams, questions, and results.
Create appropriate database schemas and relationships.

- **Frontend Development (Angular):**

Develop responsive and user-friendly web pages for registration, login, exam taking, and results viewing.
Implement dynamic forms for exam creation and question management.
Use Angular routing for navigation between pages.

-**Backend Development (Spring Boot):**

Create RESTful APIs to handle user registration, authentication, exam management, and scoring.
Implement business logic for exam processing and grading.
Integrate with the database to store and retrieve data.
